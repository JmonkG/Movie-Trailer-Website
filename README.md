#1rst Proyect for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
#Movie Trailer Website

The project has 4 files:
fresh_tomatoes.py .- Contains the html css and javascript code to run the page
movie.py .- the data structure for a Movie Object
movies.txt .- the file with all the information for each movie
MovieTrailer.py.- the running file code.

To execute the program, please run MovieTrailes.py. When you run this code, it will read from
movies.txt the details of each movie and create a Movie object, then add it to the list. After
that, it passes the list to the open_movie_page in fres_tomatoes to execute the code and show
via browser the correspondent movies.
